//! Draw your game with an explicit 2D graphics API.
//!
//! Graphics in Coffee focus on simplicity while __reducing global state__.
//! Operations like matrix transformations, off-screen rendering and draw calls
//! have always an explicit scope. In Coffee, you do not have to remember to pop
//! a transformation from the matrix stack, reset the render target, reset the
//! screen coordinates, etc. There are no global functions!
//!
//! # Basic concepts
//! The graphics module revolves around three concepts: [graphics processors],
//! [targets], and [resources].
//!
//! ## Graphics processors
//! A [`Gpu`] represents a link between your game and a graphics processor. It
//! is necessary to perform any kind of graphical operation, like loading
//! resources and drawing.
//!
//! As of now, you will only have one [`Gpu`] available at a given time.
//! However, in the future, the graphics module may allow recording graphical
//! operations concurrently.
//!
//! ## Targets
//! A [`Target`] represents a drawable target on a specific [`Gpu`]. A
//! [`Transformation`] can be applied to them.
//!
//! Any kind of draw operation needs an explicit [`Target`]. For example,
//! [`Image::draw`] needs a reference to a [`Target`] as the last argument.
//!
//! Currently, there are two ways to obtain a [`Target`]: either from a
//! [`Frame`] or a [`Canvas`], using the `as_target` method.
//!
//! ## Resources
//! A resource is the source of some drawable object. In Coffee, there is no
//! `Resource` or `Drawable` type/trait. Resources are represented by different
//! types like [`Image`], [`Font`], [`TextureArray`], etc.
//!
//! # Getting started
//! You should probably start your [`Game::draw`] implementation by clearing
//! the provided [`Frame`]:
//!
//! ```
//! use coffee::graphics::{Color, Frame, Window};
//! use coffee::{Game, Timer};
//! # use coffee::Result;
//! # use coffee::graphics::Gpu;
//! # use coffee::load::Task;
//! #
//! # struct MyGame;
//!
//! impl Game for MyGame {
//! #   type Input = ();
//! #   type LoadingScreen = ();
//! #
//! #   fn load(window: &Window) -> Task<MyGame> {
//! #       Task::new(|| MyGame)
//! #   }
//! #
//!     // ...
//!
//!     fn draw(&mut self, frame: &mut Frame, _timer: &Timer) {
//!         frame.clear(Color::BLACK);
//!
//!         // Use your resources here...
//!         // self.image.draw(Sprite { ... }, &mut frame.as_target());
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can load your resources during [`Game::load`]. Check out the different
//! types in this module to get a basic understanding of which kind of resources
//! are supported.
